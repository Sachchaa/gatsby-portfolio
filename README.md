This is a portfolio website project developed using Gatsby, React, GraphQL, Strapi for the backend and deployed using Netlify.

In this app, I have used Gatsby plugins such as gatsby-image, gatsby-plugin-react-helmet, gatsby-source-strapi, gatsby-plugin-sitemap and gatsby-plugin-google-fonts. In addition I have used React hooks such as useState and useEffect also, I have used react-icons, MaterialUI and Bootstrap also, Formspree for the form in contact me page.
